## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not disclose suspected vulnerabilities publicly before maintainers have had an opportunity to validate and remediate them.

To report a vulnerability:
- [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/hmlendea/argononeup-automatic-shutdown/security/advisories)
- Contact the maintainers directly

## 📌 Scope

The original maintainers are not responsible for changes, modifications, or security issues introduced by downstream forks.

The subsequent report categories are in scope for this repository:
- Vulnerabilities in the shutdown script (`argononeup-automatic-shutdown.sh`)
- Vulnerabilities in the installation script (`install`)
- Vulnerabilities in the uninstallation script (`uninstall`)
- Vulnerabilities in the systemd service file (`argononeup-automatic-shutdown.service`)

The subsequent categories are out of scope unless explicitly stated to the contrary:
- Vulnerabilities in system dependencies (systemd, GNOME Mutter, Linux kernel, util-linux, gpioget)
- Vulnerabilities introduced by downstream forks or modifications
- Issues in the host operating system or hardware
- Configuration errors by the instance operator

## 📢 Disclosure Policy

This project follows coordinated disclosure:
1. Vulnerabilities are investigated privately.
2. A remediation plan is prepared and validated.
3. Public disclosure is published after a fix, mitigation, or agreed risk decision is available.
4. Credit is attributed in accordance with reporter preference and project policy.

## 🧾 Safe Harbour

If your research is conducted in good faith, confined to authorised scope, and disclosed responsibly, the maintainers will not pursue action for policy-compliant activity.

## 🙏 Recognition

We appreciate responsible disclosure. Reporters who desire public attribution may be acknowledged in release notes, advisories, or a dedicated acknowledgements section.
